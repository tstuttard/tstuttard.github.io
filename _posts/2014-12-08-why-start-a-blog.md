title: Why I Started a Blog
---
There are many reasons that people have for starting a blog. You might start one because you are passionate
about a certain topic. Maybe you felt that there were few blogs that talked about garden ponds*.
Some blogs are there for making money through the use of adverts and/or affiliate links.

Aside from my own actual reasons for starting a blog, if I was to pick from the above it would be about making money.
Sure I am passionate about programming but I have not found that passion for talking about it to a somewhat ghost
audience. Programming isn't a niche topic either so it kinda rules that out. The idea of making money out of
something through giving my opinion, experiences or even tutorials on a certain topic, seems like it could be
really worth that 20 mins each day you would spend writing blog posts.

Imagine being able to have time for the things you love doing like spending time with friends or family;
having time for that personal project you have been planning for months/years;
or even just having time to relax because you are financially secure. That is some dreamy, idea that
I feel would be worth investing my time and effort to see if it is personally feasible.
Having said all that, a blog probably doesn't start making you some dollars over night,
probably doesn't make you any dollars in a few months and may not make you any dollars at all,
but I am gonna give it a go in my spare time and see what happens.

Money is a secondary reason for starting this blog. A bigger reason I have is so that my friends and
family can see what I am getting up to when I spend a year travelling around Australia.
I want them to be able to browse to this blog and read this as if I was telling them face to face.
Sure I could skype them each week or let them know via facebook but with skype you have to cope
with different timezones ( Melbourne is 11 hours ahead of Scotland ) and with facebook you don't have
the same story telling experience as you would face to face.

But although money is a big part of life and also keeping in touch with friends and family,
maintaing your relationships with them, there is another reason why I am starting this blog.
I read a couple of weeks ago on  another random blogger's blog whose posts I read frequently and he talked
about meeting a New York City police officer. He talked about how the police officer telling him loads of
different experiences and adventures he had had over the course of his 30+ years working in the NYPD.
At one point during the conversation the blogger asked "Do you have any regrets about your career as city cop?"
and the officer replied with "If there was one thing that I could change throughout my entire career working in the
NYPD, it would keep a journal from when I first started rather than for my last 8 years.".

I may not be able to remember every last thing I have ever done however I am going to ensure I can read
about the majority of them by writing them down.
